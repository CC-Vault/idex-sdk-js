The official library for [IDEX 2.0's](https://idex.io) REST and WebSocket APIs

*Important: This SDK supports the all-new [IDEX 2.0](https://idex.io), now available for integation via a fully-functional [testnet sandbox](https://docs.idex.io/#sandbox). [IDEX 1.0](https://idex.market) and its [API](https://docs.idex.market) will continue to operate for a short period of time as IDEX's mainnet exchange, allowing the community to upgrade integrations. It is not recommended to start any new development for the IDEX 1.0 API.*

Complete documentation for the IDEX 2.0 API is available at https://docs.idex.io.

## Features

- Easy functionality to use in programmatic trading
- A WebSocket-backed real-time order book implementation
- Clients with convenient methods for every API endpoint
- Abstracted interfaces â€“ don't worry about HMAC signing, JSON formatting, or ECDSA signatures; the library does it for you
- Supports both Node.js and browser environments
- Written in Typescript with full typings for all requests and responses

## Installation

```bash
npm install @idexio/idex-sdk
